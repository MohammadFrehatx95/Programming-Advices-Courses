Rename a Table (Most Databases)

Rename table (In SQL Server)
You can not use the ALTER TABLE statement in SQL Server to rename a table. However, you can use sp_rename, though Microsoft recommends that you drop and recreate the table so that scripts and stored procedures are not broken.

Syntax
The syntax to rename a table in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is:

exec sp_rename 'old_table_name', 'new_table_name';
