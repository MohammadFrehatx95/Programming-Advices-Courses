SQL JOIN
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

Different Types of SQL JOINs
Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table






SQL INNER JOIN
The SQL INNER JOIN joins two tables based on a common column, and selects records that have matching values in these columns.







Example
SELECT Customers.customer_id, Customers.first_name, Orders.amount
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders
ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer;


Here, the SQL command selects customer_id and first_name columns (from the Customers table) and the amount column (from the Orders table).

And, the result set will contain those rows where there is a match between customer_id (of the Customers table) and customer (of the Orders table).

Syntax of INNER JOIN
The syntax of INNER JOIN is:

SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
INNER JOIN With WHERE Clause
Here's an example of the INNER JOIN with the WHERE clause:

SELECT Customers.customer_id, Customers.first_name, Orders.amount
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders
ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer
WHERE Orders.amount >= 500;


Here, the SQL command joins two tables and selects rows where the amount is greater than or equal to 500.

mysql
-- Join and Inner Join are the same

select * from Customers;

select * from Orders;


SELECT Customers.CustomerID, Customers.Name, Orders.Amount
FROM Customers 
JOIN Orders 
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;



SELECT Customers.CustomerID, Customers.Name, Orders.Amount
FROM Customers 
Inner JOIN Orders 
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
