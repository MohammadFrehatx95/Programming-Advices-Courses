SQL DROP TABLE Statement
In SQL, DROP TABLE is used to delete the tables in our database. For example,

DROP TABLE Employees;
Here, the SQL command will delete a table named Employees.

Also make sure you have admin or DROP permission to run this command.

Note: When we delete a database table, all records within a table are also deleted.
