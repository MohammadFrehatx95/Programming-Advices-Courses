SQL LEFT JOIN Keyword
The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records from the right table (table2). The result is 0 records from the right side, if there is no match.

LEFT JOIN Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

Note: In some databases LEFT JOIN is called LEFT OUTER JOIN.



The SQL LEFT JOIN joins two tables based on a common column, and selects records that have matching values in these columns and remaining rows from the left table.





Example
SELECT Customers.customer_id, Customers.first_name, Orders.amount
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer;




Here, the SQL command selects customer_id and first_name columns (from the Customers table) and the amount column (from the Orders table).

And, the result set will contain those rows where there is a match between customer_id (of the Customers table) and customer (of the Orders table) along with all the remaining rows from the Customers table.



mysql


--Left Join and Left Outer Join are the same.

--Left Join: gets all data from table customers and only matched data from table orders
SELECT Customers.CustomerID, Customers.Name, Orders.Amount
FROM Customers 
Left JOIN Orders 
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;


SELECT Customers.CustomerID, Customers.Name, Orders.Amount
FROM Customers 
Left Outer JOIN Orders 
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
