The SQL SELECT TOP Clause
The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

The SELECT TOP clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact performance.

Note: Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records, while Oracle uses FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY and ROWNUM.

SQL Server / MS Access Syntax:

SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

mysql

Select * from Employees;


-- This will show top 5 employees.
Select top 5 * from Employees;


-- This will show top 10% of the data.
select top 10 percent * from Employees;

-- this will show the all salaries ordered from the heighest to lowest.
select  MonthlySalary from employees
order by MonthlySalary Desc;



-- this will show the all salaries ordered from the heighest to lowest without redundancy.
select distinct MonthlySalary from employees
order by MonthlySalary Desc;

-- this will show the heighest 3 salaries.
select  distinct  top 3 MonthlySalary from employees
order by MonthlySalary Desc;


--This will show all employees who takes one of the heighest 3 salaries.
