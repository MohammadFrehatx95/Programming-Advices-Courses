The SQL HAVING Clause
The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions in a direct way.

HAVING Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);

mysql


select DepartmentID, TotalCount=Count(MonthlySalary), 
	   TotalSum=Sum(MonthlySalary),
	   Average=Avg(MonthlySalary),
	   MinSalary=Min(MonthlySalary),
	   MaxSalary=Max(MonthlySalary) 
	   
	   from Employees
	
       Group By DepartmentID
	  
	   order by DepartmentID


--Having is the where satement for group by
select DepartmentID, TotalCount=Count(MonthlySalary), 
	   TotalSum=Sum(MonthlySalary),
	   Average=Avg(MonthlySalary),
	   MinSalary=Min(MonthlySalary),
	   MaxSalary=Max(MonthlySalary) 
	   
	   from Employees
       Group By DepartmentID
	  having Count(MonthlySalary) > 100



-- Same solution without having :-)
select * from 
(

   select DepartmentID, TotalCount=Count(MonthlySalary), 
	   TotalSum=Sum(MonthlySalary),
	   Average=Avg(MonthlySalary),
	   MinSalary=Min(MonthlySalary),
	   MaxSalary=Max(MonthlySalary) 
	   
	   from Employees
	
       Group By DepartmentID
	  
) R1

where R1.TotalCount> 100;
