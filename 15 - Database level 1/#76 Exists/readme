The SQL EXISTS Operator
The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery.

The EXISTS operator returns TRUE if the subquery returns one or more records.

EXISTS Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE EXISTS
(SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);

The SQL EXISTS operator executes the outer SQL query if the subquery is not NULL (empty result-set).

mysql



select X='yes'
where  exists 
   ( 
	select * from Orders
	where customerID= 3 and Amount < 600
	)


select * from Customers T1
where 
  exists 
   ( 
	select * from Orders
	where customerID= T1.CustomerID and Amount < 600
	)

--More optimized and faster
select * from Customers T1
where 
  exists 
   ( 
	select top 1 * from Orders
	where customerID= T1.CustomerID and Amount < 600
	)


--More optimized and faster
select * from Customers T1
where 
  exists 
   ( 
	select top 1 R='Y'  from Orders
	where customerID= T1.CustomerID and Amount < 600
	)
