The SQL LIKE Operator
The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:

 The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters
 The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character


Note: MS Access uses an asterisk (*) instead of the percent sign (%), and a question mark (?) instead of the underscore (_).

The percent sign and the underscore can also be used in combinations!

LIKE Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;

Tip: You can also combine any number of conditions using AND or OR operators.

Here are some examples showing different LIKE operators with '%' and '_' wildcards:



mysql

select * from Employees;

--Finds any values that start with "a"
select ID, FirstName from Employees
where FirstName like 'a%';


--Finds any values that end with "a"
select ID, FirstName from Employees
where FirstName like '%a';


--Finds any values that have "tell" in any position
select ID, FirstName from Employees
where FirstName like '%tell%';

--	Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "a"
select ID, FirstName from Employees
where FirstName like 'a%a';

--Finds any values that have "a" in the second position
select ID, FirstName from Employees
where FirstName like '_a%';

--Finds any values that have "a" in the third position
select ID, FirstName from Employees
where FirstName like '__a%';


--Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
select ID, FirstName from Employees
where FirstName like 'a__%';

--Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 4 characters in length
select ID, FirstName from Employees
where FirstName like 'a___%';



--Finds any values that start with "a"
select ID, FirstName from Employees
where FirstName like 'a%' or FirstName like 'b%' ;
